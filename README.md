<h1 align="center">Nx Cloud Github Workflows</h1>

âœ¨ Github Workflows for easily configuring distributed CI pipelines powered by the speed and intelligence of Nx Cloud.

## Disclaimer: Github Workflow Limitations

These workflows are intended to save folks time and complexity in getting up and running with Nx Cloud and Github Actions. They are _NOT_ intended to be a one-size-fits-all CI solution.

They will scale to workspaces of essentially any size thanks to the way they can distribute and parallelize tasks, however, that does not mean that they are infinitely configurable.

The workflows found here leverage a relatively new feature of Github called reusable workflows: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows

The extensibility of these Nx Cloud workflows is therefore strictly bound by the capabilities of the Github feature.

This means that you cannot do things such as embed additional Github actions within the workflow, or majorly customize the steps we have set up for you.

If you find yourself needing to customize things beyond what is supported by Github reusable workflows, then the best way is to simply take a look at the source of the workflows within this repo [./.github/workflows](./.github/workflows) and use that as your starting point directly within your configs.

## Example Usage

The following will configure a CI workflow that runs on the `main` branch, and on all pull requests into the `main` branch. The CI workflow will do the following:

- Checkout your repo at the appropriate depth for determining affected projects
- Determine the `head` and `base` SHAs to use for `nx affected`
- Install nodejs
- Use an appropriate node_module caching strategy for either `yarn`, `npm` or `pnpm` (depending on which one is configured in your repo)
- Install locked dependencies with either `yarn`, `npm` or `pnpm` (depending on which one is configured in your repo)
- Spawn 3 agents ready to receive tasks/targets to run
- Initiate all the provided commands in parallel, with those defined in `parallel-commands` being executed on the main job, and those in `parallel-commands-on-agents` being intelligently distributed across the 3 agents by Nx Cloud
- Shut down all agents when all parallel tasks have been completed

<!-- start example-usage -->

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

```

## Adding read-write Nx Cloud access token to workflow

The main and agent workflows both support passing `NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the parent workflow.
These secrets are still kept encrypted and the `main` workflow will only use the `NX_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`
if those are defined.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.number || github.ref }}

    name: Nx Cloud - Main Job
